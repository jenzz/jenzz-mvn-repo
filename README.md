jenzz public Maven repository
=============================

This is a simple repository for open source Maven projects.

I usually host my projects on [JCenter()](https://bintray.com/bintray/jcenter). The stuff you can find here is probably of a temporary nature only.

Usage with Gradle
=================

If you want to refer to this repo using Gradle, you can do it like this:

```
repositories {
    maven { url 'https://github.com/jenzz/jenzz-mvn-repo/raw/master/releases' }
